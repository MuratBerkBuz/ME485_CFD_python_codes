# ME485_CFD_python_codes
These are the files that I have used for ME485 lecture projects at Middle East Technical University. Created by Ali Karaku≈ü.
The main gain from this lecture has been using already written codes and manipulating them to do certain jobs with the code. 
For example, we have integrated different gradient reconstruction methods and implemented steady diffusion discretization, unsteady diffusion discretization, and various flux-limiting approaches.
